# Laraxot Coding Standards

This document outlines key coding standards and best practices specific to the Laraxot methodology. Adhering to these conventions is mandatory to ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

## Eloquent Models

### `casts()` Method vs. `$casts` Property

In alignment with modern Laravel (version 11+), the `protected $casts` property is **deprecated**. All Eloquent models **must** use the `casts()` method to define attribute casting.

**Bad:**
```php
class User extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'is_admin' => 'boolean',
        'options' => 'array',
    ];
}
```

**Good:**
```php
class User extends Model
{
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'is_admin' => 'boolean',
            'options' => 'array',
        ];
    }
}
```
This approach is more consistent with other method-based configurations in Laravel and avoids potential issues with property overriding in complex inheritance scenarios.

## Configuration Files

### `config/database.php` Synchronization

The `config/database.php` file should be kept in sync with the version from the official [laravel/laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) repository for the project's current major Laravel version.

**Why:**
- **Compatibility:** Ensures all available configuration options are present.
- **Security:** Incorporates the latest security-related changes and best practices from the framework.
- **New Features:** Provides access to new database connection features as they are added to Laravel.

**Action:** Before a major Laravel upgrade or when debugging database connection issues, always compare the project's `config/database.php` with the upstream version.
