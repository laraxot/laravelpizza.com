# Translation Conflict Resolution Prototype

## Overview
This document describes the prototype for resolving Git conflicts in Laravel translation files while preserving all translation content.

## Conflict Types Identified

### Type 1: Complete Structure Conflicts
**Example**: `Modules/User/lang/it/device.php`
- One version has rich structure with `tooltip`, `helper_text`, `actions`, `navigation`, etc.
- Other version has minimal structure with basic `label`, `placeholder`, `help` fields
- **Resolution Strategy**: Merge both structures, prioritizing the richer version while preserving unique content from minimal version

### Type 2: Partial Key Conflicts
**Example**: `Modules/User/lang/it/edit_role.php`, `permission.php`
- Some keys exist in one version but not in another
- **Resolution Strategy**: Add missing keys from both versions

### Type 3: Duplicate Sections
**Example**: `Modules/TechPlanner/lang/it/appointment.php`
- Same sections appear twice without conflict markers
- **Resolution Strategy**: Merge duplicate content, removing redundancy

## Resolution Algorithm

### Step 1: Parse Conflict Markers
