# User Module PRD (Product Requirements Document)

**Status**: ✅ Finalized
**Version**: 2.5.0
**Last Update**: 2026-09-21
**Method**: BMAD PRD Creation

## 🎯 Product Vision

The User module is the **foundational identity layer** for PTVX, providing authentication, authorization, user management, team collaboration, and multi-tenancy. It must be **secure by default**, **performant**, **developer-friendly**, and **maintainable** with minimal technical debt.

## 📋 Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Authentication System
- **FR-1.1**: Multi-factor authentication (credentials, OAuth, SSO, 2FA)
- **FR-1.2**: Secure password handling (bcrypt, expiration, reset flows)
- **FR-1.3**: Session management (creation, validation, expiration, device tracking)
- **FR-1.4**: Token management (Sanctum API tokens, Passport OAuth2 tokens)

#### FR-2: Authorization System
- **FR-2.1**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via Spatie Permission
- **FR-2.2**: Team-based permissions with hierarchical inheritance
- **FR-2.3**: Tenant-based isolation with row-level security
- **FR-2.4**: Policy-based authorization for fine-grained control

#### FR-3: User Management
- **FR-3.1**: Complete CRUD for users with profile management
- **FR-3.2**: User lifecycle (create, activate, deactivate, delete, restore)
- **FR-3.3**: Profile management with schemaless attributes
- **FR-3.4**: Avatar and media management

#### FR-4: Team Collaboration
- **FR-4.1**: Team creation, ownership, and management
- **FR-4.2**: Member invitations with role assignment
- **FR-4.3**: Team hierarchy with permission inheritance
- **FR-4.4**: Current team switching

#### FR-5: Multi-Tenancy
- **FR-5.1**: Tenant creation and configuration
- **FR-5.2**: User-tenant associations with roles
- **FR-5.3**: Tenant isolation modes (none, soft, hard)
- **FR-5.4**: Tenant switching for multi-tenant users

#### FR-6: Admin Interface (Filament)
- **FR-6.1**: Comprehensive user administration
- **FR-6.2**: Role and permission management
- **FR-6.3**: Team and tenant administration
- **FR-6.4**: Security monitoring and audit logs

#### FR-7: Social & SSO Integration
- **FR-7.1**: Social login (Google, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft)
- **FR-7.2**: SSO provider integration
- **FR-7.3**: Account linking and unlinking
- **FR-7.4**: Domain-based access control

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-1: Security
- **NFR-1.1**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **NFR-1.2**: OWASP Top 10 compliance
- **NFR-1.3**: Complete audit trail for all auth events
- **NFR-1.4**: Rate limiting and abuse prevention

#### NFR-2: Performance
- **NFR-2.1**: <100ms average authentication response
- **NFR-2.2**: <200ms user list rendering (1000+ users)
- **NFR-2.3**: <500ms tenant switching
- **NFR-2.4**: Efficient database queries (N+1 prevention)

#### NFR-3: Maintainability
- **NFR-3.1**: PHPStan Level 10 compliance
- **NFR-3.2**: >90% test coverage
- **NFR-3.3**: Comprehensive documentation (kebab-case)
- **NFR-3.4**: Zero PHPMD violations

#### NFR-4: Scalability
- **NFR-4.1**: Support 100,000+ users
- **NFR-4.2**: Support 1,000+ teams
- **NFR-4.3**: Support 100+ tenants
- **NFR-4.4**: Horizontal scaling readiness

#### NFR-5: Developer Experience
- **NFR-5.1**: Clear API contracts with type safety
- **NFR-5.2**: Comprehensive IDE support (PHPDoc)
- **NFR-5.3**: Easy extension points (traits, actions, events)
- **NFR-5.4**: Consistent patterns across module

## 👥 User Personas

| Persona | Needs | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **System Admin** | Full user/role/tenant management, security audit | P0 |
| **Tenant Admin** | Tenant user management, role assignment | P0 |
| **Team Manager** | Team member management, permissions | P1 |
| **End User** | Profile, password, 2FA, device management | P0 |
| **Security Officer** | Authentication logs, anomaly detection | P1 |
| **Developer** | Clean APIs, extensibility, documentation | P1 |

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Authentication Success Rate | 99.9% | Login analytics |
| Average Login Time | <500ms | Performance monitoring |
| Security Incidents | 0/year | Security audit |
| Test Coverage | 95% | Pest reports |
| PHPStan Errors | 0 | CI pipeline |
| Documentation Quality | A grade | Doc quality audit |
| Developer Onboarding Time | <2 hours | Team survey |

## 🚫 Out of Scope
- User-facing public registration flows (handled by application modules)
- Advanced workflow/BPM integration
- Third-party identity provider management UI
- Complex organizational hierarchies beyond teams

## 🔄 Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
