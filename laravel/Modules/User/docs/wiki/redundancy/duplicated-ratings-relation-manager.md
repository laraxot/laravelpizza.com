# Duplicated RatingsRelationManager

## Problem
`RatingsRelationManager.php` appears in at least 3 different places.

## Impact
- Same rating attachment logic duplicated
- Risk of inconsistent rating behavior across different entities
- Maintenance burden

## Recommended Fix
- Centralize in `Modules/Rating` (or a shared place) and make other modules consume it via relation manager or reusable component.

## Related
- Issue #90
