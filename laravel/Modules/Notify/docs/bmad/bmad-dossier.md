# Notify: BMAD dossier
## Product brief / PRD
Deliver preference-aware mail/SMS/WhatsApp/Telegram/FCM messages with observable outcomes.
## Architecture / UX / security
Channel adapters consume common intent; Job dispatches after commit; secrets and verified destinations stay outside docs/logs.
## Epics and stories
Channel contract; templates/preferences; retry/failure/monitoring.
## Gaps / release
Worker/SMTP sandbox, failed jobs, push tokens, idempotency and provider fallback are not candidate-verified.
