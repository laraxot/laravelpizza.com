# Cms — BMAD dossier
## Product brief / PRD
Let each municipality manage pages, menus, blocks and localized service/privacy content.
## Architecture / UX / security
Cms owns authoring/publication; Folio themes render data; tenant, role and cache boundaries are enforced.
## Epics and stories
Authoring; preview/publish; locale fallback/cache invalidation. Stories cover missing content and stale cache recovery.
## Gaps / release
Preview permissions, cache invalidation and tenant isolation require candidate evidence. Release requires approved localized content with no raw keys.
