# Git Conflict Inventory

- Date: 2026-04-28
- Owner: Modules/Tenant
- Files with conflict markers: 1

## Files

- Inventory generated from `rg -l "^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)"`.
- Use this list as a volatile coordination map; re-open each file before editing because other agents may resolve items in parallel.
