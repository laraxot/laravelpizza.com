# Model/Factory/Seeder Audit

Generated: [DATE] 16:29

## Coverage
| Model | Factory | Seeded |
|---|---|---|
| Translation | yes | no |
| TranslationFile | yes | no |
| Post | yes | no |
| LinkedTrait | n/a | n/a |
| HasStrictTranslations | n/a | n/a |
| HasTranslationsContract | n/a | n/a |

Seeder: `database/seeders/LangDatabaseSeeder.php`

## Missing / Actions
- Add exemplar seeding for `Translation`/`TranslationFile`/`Post` if needed for demos/tests.
- Traits/contracts are infra; exclude from factories/seeders.

## Likely non-business-critical
- All trait/contract entries (infra-only).
