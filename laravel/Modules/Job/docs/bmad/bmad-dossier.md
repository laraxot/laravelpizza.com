# Job: BMAD dossier
## Product brief / PRD
Run imports, exports, notifications and scheduled work reliably without losing transactions.
## Architecture / UX / security
Laravel queue/jobs use after-commit dispatch, idempotency and safe replay; domain meaning stays with owner modules.
## Epics and stories
Worker reliability; failed-job operations; replay/retention.
## Gaps / release
Worker, failed_jobs, alerts, idempotency and RPO/RTO are not candidate-verified. Release requires failure injection and replay evidence.
