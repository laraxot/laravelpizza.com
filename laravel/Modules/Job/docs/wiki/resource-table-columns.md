# Resource table columns

## BMAD story and evidence

As an administrator I need identifiable records and operational state without oversized technical columns. Acceptance: string-keyed `array<string, Column>`, fields backed by models and migrations (or Sushi schemas), sortable dates, optional technical details.

Imports/exports use file_name and row counts; waiting jobs use queue and attempts; failed imports expose validation_error; schedules expose command/expression/status. Jobs available_at and reserved_at are UNIX integer timestamps.

Sources: `app/Models`, `database/migrations`, existing resource `Pages/List*.php` and `Tables/*Table.php`. QMD query attempted before editing: unavailable because better-sqlite3 ABI 127 differs from Node ABI 147; direct source inspection used.
